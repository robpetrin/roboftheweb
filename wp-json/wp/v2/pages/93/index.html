I&#8217;m Rob, and I&#8217;ve been developing websites for over 25 years. I got my start in the early years of the world-wide web when I was a pre-teen, and have loved it ever since. I&#8217;ve also spent time as a writer and educator, which led me to open this website. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A lot of people find web development intimidating, when there&#8217;s really no reason to.<\/strong> I love teaching people about the web, and demystifying it. It&#8217;s possible for anyone to start web development without much preparation, and without paying for any software or hosting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Background<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m originally from Rhode Island, and am a life-long New Englander. I currently reside just outside of Boston, working full-time as a front-end web developer. I live with my wife, our dog \ud83d\udc15, and our red-eared slider \ud83d\udc22.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I&#8217;m not working on websites, I&#8217;m working on this site, a YouTube video (or five), or my courses and other educational materials. When I&#8217;m not doing that, I enjoy Boston sports, All Elite Wrestling, and working on my house.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Educational &amp; Professional<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I graduated with my bachelor&#8217;s degree in Writing &amp; Rhetoric from the <strong><mark style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#002147\" class=\"has-inline-color\"><a href=\"https:\/\/harrington.uri.edu\/academics\/writing-and-rhetoric-b-a\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">University of Rhode Island<\/a><\/mark><\/strong> in Kingston, RI in 2009. I wasn&#8217;t immediately sure what to do with myself after college, but I&#8217;ve used my degree in every professional position since attaining it. Writing is a valuable skill taught to too few people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I graduated with my master&#8217;s degree in Secondary Education from <strong><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.sju.edu\/degree-programs\/education-secondary-education-grades-7-12\" target=\"_blank\"><mark style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9e1b32\" class=\"has-inline-color\">Saint Joseph&#8217;s University<\/mark><\/a><\/strong> in Philadelphia, PA in 2012. I then shifted to teaching roles, primarily in Central Massachusetts. I taught both Social Studies and Special Education in a variety of public, charter, and parochial settings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I formalized my self-taught web skills by completing <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/scrimba.com\/learn\/frontend\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><mark style=\"background-color:#fffbd6\" class=\"has-inline-color\">Scrimba&#8217;s Front-End Career Path<\/mark><\/strong><\/a> in 2021. Since leaving education in 2017, I&#8217;ve worked primarily in marketing agency settings, serving as both a Project Manager and Lead Web Developer, working mostly with clients on WordPress.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I launched my own creative agency in 2022, <strong><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/petrin.dev\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https:\/\/petrin.dev\" target=\"_blank\"><mark style=\"background-color:#fff6eb;color:#113537\" class=\"has-inline-color\">Petrin Development Services<\/mark><\/a><\/strong>, to better market myself, and the skills I can provide to small business owners in my area.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can view more of my work using the links in the footer, particularly my GitHub and CodePen profiles.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>About Rob Hey!
