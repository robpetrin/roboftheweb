This includes web references, web tools, code editors, CMS software, and more. In this article, we&#8217;re going to assess seven distinct tools, and why you should select them over their chief competitors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>None of the applications below are sponsoring this post, or my recommendation of them. Feel free to do your own research &#8212; <strong>Googling is a developer&#8217;s best friend!<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Instant Prototyping: <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/codepen.io\/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https:\/\/codepen.io\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">CodePen<\/a><\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Price: <\/strong>Free (with a Pro tier)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I use CodePen almost daily when creating small prototypes, one-off WordPress components, or mini-projects to showcase. It includes editor panes for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and supports processors and supersets of each language. It&#8217;s an excellent sandbox to try out code, fork someone else&#8217;s Pen, or to experiment with external libraries and frameworks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For free, you get unlimited public pens and unlimited templates. For Pro ($8\/mo), you get asset hosting (file storage), project support, collaboration and debug mode, private pens, ad removal, and live view.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Chief Competitor: <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/jsfiddle.net\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">JSFiddle<\/a>. While CodePen is more intended for front-end mockups, JSFiddle is used primarily for JavaScript experimenting. You have to hit &#8220;Run&#8221; to see your updates, whereas this is instantaneous on CodePen. So, depending upon your use-case, JSFiddle might be a better or worse fit. For front-end purposes, typically CodePen is a sleeker editing experience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Code Editing: <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/code.visualstudio.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">VSCode<\/a><\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Price: <\/strong>Free (open-source)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Visual Code Studio is my pick for two main reasons &#8212; it&#8217;s the most popular, and because of it&#8217;s extension ecosystem. Keep those factors in mind when I get to CMSes later in this article.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your IDE (integrated development environment) is the most important tool you&#8217;ll use when writing code, for obvious reasons. It needs to be crafted to your workflow &#8212; colors, plugins, presets, keyboard shortcuts, etc. &#8212; to ensure you continue to work quickly and productively. VSCode is highly configurable, and widely adopted.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Chief Competitor: <\/strong><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/atom.io\/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https:\/\/atom.io\/\" target=\"_blank\">Atom<\/a>. There&#8217;s a lot to like with Atom, which is based on Electron (Node.JS). It&#8217;s been plagued by performance issues in the past, and has nowhere near the adoption of VSCode. But it&#8217;s worth a look.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Design Mockups: <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.figma.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Figma<\/a><\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Price: <\/strong>Free (with paid tiers)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is assuming my audience is primary developers. For Designers, I might have a different recommendation. However, I love Figma because it feels like a design tool with developers in mind. Like VSCode, a wide plugin ecosystem doesn&#8217;t hurt. In fact, a number of plugins can help the export and initial development cycles. Such a time-saver.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Chief Competitor: <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.adobe.com\/products\/xd.html\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https:\/\/www.adobe.com\/products\/xd.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Adobe XD<\/a>. It&#8217;s recommend this to designers, as it&#8217;s a lovely tool. But it does more to scaffold web design for traditional designers than it does to scaffold web developer handover. However, it still does a good job of the latter the same way it does the former.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Local Development: <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/localwp.com\/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https:\/\/localwp.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Local by Flywheel<\/a><\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Price: <\/strong>Free (but hosting isn&#8217;t)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A big reason for this recommendation is that this is owned by Flywheel (good), which is itself owned by WPEngine (great). The ability to, in a single click, sync from Local to remote and back is key. It&#8217;s incredibly easy to spin up a local WordPress instance in minutes, and this makes working with a three-environment setup a no-brainer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is the simplest way to work with WordPress locally &#8212; full-stop.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Chief Competitor: <\/strong><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.oreilly.com\/library\/view\/learning-php-mysql\/9781449337452\/ch02s01.html#:~:text=WAMP%2C%20MAMP%2C%20and%20LAMP%20are,developing%20dynamic%20Internet%20web%20pages.\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https:\/\/www.oreilly.com\/library\/view\/learning-php-mysql\/9781449337452\/ch02s01.html#:~:text=WAMP%2C%20MAMP%2C%20and%20LAMP%20are,developing%20dynamic%20Internet%20web%20pages.\" target=\"_blank\">WAMP, MAMP, and LAMP<\/a> &#8212; but why go through the abstraction if it&#8217;s not key to your hosting circumstances? I really cannot recommend considering this alternative unless it fits your use-case &#8212; in which case you&#8217;re likely not a beginner or relatively new to development.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Version Management: <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\" data-type=\"URL\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">GitHub<\/a><\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Price: <\/strong>Free (with paid tiers)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.webdesignerdepot.com\/2021\/07\/poll-the-ethical-dilemma-at-the-heart-of-githubs-copilot\/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https:\/\/www.webdesignerdepot.com\/2021\/07\/poll-the-ethical-dilemma-at-the-heart-of-githubs-copilot\/\" target=\"_blank\">ethical reasons<\/a> to reconsider GitHub. However, its wide adoption means it is a big step down to one of its competitors. Ultimately, all Git providers are the same. It&#8217;s underlying technology that neither GitHub nor its competitors solely control. It&#8217;s just a brand-name thing &#8212; but keep an eye out for a wider boycott I suppose, which can hurt its market leader status.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Chief Competitors: <\/strong><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/gitlab.com\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https:\/\/gitlab.com\" target=\"_blank\">GitLab<\/a>, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/bitbucket.org\/product\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https:\/\/bitbucket.org\/product\" target=\"_blank\">BitBucket<\/a> &#8212; truly, all Git providers are roughly the same.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Content Management System: <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">WordPress<\/a><\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Price: <\/strong>Free (open-source)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress, as I foreshadowed, is my pick due to market share (~1\/3 of all websites run WordPress, and almost 2\/3 of sites using a CMS are using WordPress) and plugin ecosystem. For every website use case, there&#8217;s a WordPress solutions. In so many cases, it&#8217;s better than the alternative of building something natively.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the advent of Gutenberg and Full-Site Editing in 2022, the landscape for WordPress developers is going to change. Drastically. And quickly. While WordPress isn&#8217;t expected to remove PHP from it&#8217;s core code anytime soon, it&#8217;s neutered the need for any developers to touch it besides here-and-there in 2022. It&#8217;s possible to utilize all of WordPress without touching PHP. What a glorious sentence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Chief Competitors: <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.drupal.org\/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https:\/\/www.drupal.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Drupal<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/ghost.org\/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https:\/\/ghost.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Ghost<\/a>, Static Site Generators. Of these &#8212;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Drupal is antiquated. If WordPress is Target, Drupal is Sears. There&#8217;s no reason to pick it in 2022, and anyone who has a reason other than &#8220;cybersecurity&#8221; are lying. Anyone who says &#8220;cybersecurity&#8221; has old information.<\/li><li>Ghost is the closest experience I&#8217;ve seen to WordPress, but is a few feature releases behind it to be a real threat. It&#8217;s smooth, and definitely influenced by WordPress, and is written in Node.JS. However, it&#8217;s far less extendible than WordPress, and woefully under-featured to overcome that limitation with extension. Check back in five years.<\/li><li>Static Sites are the newest fad, but they provide legitimate security. There&#8217;s nothing to hack if your site is headless\/decoupled from the data source, which could also still be a WordPress instance. These orchestrations are a little more work, but can help make your hosting cost as little as $0\/month if you pick the right host.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Cloud Hosting: <strong><a href=\"http:\/\/netlify.com\/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"http:\/\/netlify.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Netlify<\/a><\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Price: <\/strong>Free, but paid if your usage grows high enough<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My favorite place to host static projects is on Netlify. It can do so much more than what I ask of it, and usually does it for free. While it cannot host WordPress, it easily hosts static instances of WordPress when paired with a static site-gen plugin such as <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/simply-static\/\">Simply Static<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Simplicity is the aim of Netlify, and it nails it. This will be the standard of hosting in five years, as it has its own CMS implementation (not a threat to WordPress, but remarkable). And you can&#8217;t beat free.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Chief Competitors: <\/strong><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.digitalocean.com\/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https:\/\/www.digitalocean.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Digital Ocean<\/a>, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/wpengine.com\/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https:\/\/wpengine.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">WPEngine<\/a>, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/aws.amazon.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">AWS<\/a> &#8212; none of these quite do what Netlify does. However, I can recommend each of these for slightly different use-cases.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Development Browser: <strong><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http:\/\/netlify.com\/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"http:\/\/netlify.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Chrome<\/a><\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Price: <\/strong>Free<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Much has been written about Firefox <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/dev.to\/krishnakakade\/firefox-is-the-best-browser-for-web-developers-49i7\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https:\/\/dev.to\/krishnakakade\/firefox-is-the-best-browser-for-web-developers-49i7\" target=\"_blank\">having a superior Inspector experience<\/a>, which is accurate. However, Google powers Chrome, is the market leader, and provides tools to optimize for performance, which the biggest search engine prioritizes in page rank &#8212; which just so happens to also be Google. For that reason alone, Chrome Lighthouse trumps Firefox Inspector (and Chrome&#8217;s Inspector is no slouch).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a perfect world, you&#8217;re development in each browser to gain the benefits of each. In a regular world, you&#8217;re definitely doing cross-browser review in each of them. But if you can only pick one, I say Chrome. It has a slightly larger extension ecosystem, and is in your SEO best interest.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Chief Competitor: <\/strong><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.mozilla.org\/en-US\/firefox\/new\/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https:\/\/www.mozilla.org\/en-US\/firefox\/new\/\" target=\"_blank\">Firefox<\/a>, obviously.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>For new and experienced web developers, assessing tools and resources is a critical part of your practice.
